### 🎯 **Overview:**
Drowsiness is one of the major causes of death in the world today, as a result I tried to use computer vision tools to create real-time video analytics tool that constantly checks whether or not a driver is drowsy whilst he/she is driving. In this project, I also experimented two approaches, one using Convolutional Network and the other using OpenCV and Mediapipe. The second approach is preferable.

### 🛠️ **Libraries Used:**
- Mediapipe
- OpenCV
- Numpy
- Tensorflow
